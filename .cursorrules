# Repo rules for xmlrpc-for-astro

- Use pnpm for everything, as much as possible; prefer "pnpm wrangler ..." over npx.
- TypeScript: strict; no "any"; prefer explicit return types; make everything type-safe.
- Lint/format: run "pnpm verify:fix" before proposing changes.
- Markdown: 4-space indentation; no tabs; wrap at ~100 chars.
- Code: use 4-spaced tabs in all other files (TS/JS) per .editorconfig.
- Worker: never exceed Cloudflare free subrequest budget; keep concurrency <= 6 unless told.
- Keep /health UI minimal; no frameworks; inline CSS only.
- Use KV keys exactly as documented; do not rename without migration.
- Use GitHub Actions for CI; ensure all checks pass before merging.
- Document all changes in the changelog. Create one if it doesn't exist.
- Keep commits focused and atomic. Use branches for larger features. Keep commit messages <72 chars but insightful.
- Prefer simpler code and solutions, even if they are a bit more verbose.
- When choosing between performance and readability, prioritize performance (and document with comments).
- Add code comments to explain complex logic and key features.
- Automatically write typesafe JSDocs for all functions everywhere, using definition, @params, @returns, all typed.
